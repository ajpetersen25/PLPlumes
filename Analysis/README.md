Most data is stored in .npy files (standard binary file format for an arbitrary NumPy array on disk),  
which is most easily opened and read through the NumPy python package, although it can also be opened in  
MATLAB and C++.  
Functions for doing so can be found both here (for MATLAB): https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab  
and here (for C++): https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy
